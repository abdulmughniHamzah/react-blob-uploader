# React Blob Uploader - Public Library Rules

## 🚫 Git Workflow
- ❌ Never run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` automatically
- ✅ Execute git commands only when the user explicitly requests them
- 🔄 Update this file and supporting docs whenever component APIs or structure change
- 📝 Sync any library modifications with the published `README.md` documentation immediately.

## 📄 Documentation Rules
- ❌ NEVER create separate documentation files (like REFACTORING.md, CHANGES.md, MIGRATION.md, etc.)
- ✅ ALWAYS update the existing `README.md` to reflect the current state of the project
- ✅ Keep README.md as the single source of truth for all library documentation
- ✅ Document breaking changes, new features, and API changes directly in README.md

## 🧭 Working Expectations
- Maintain framework-agnostic patterns and flat mutation results
- Keep Tailwind-based styling overrides consistent

## 📚 Full Library Reference
